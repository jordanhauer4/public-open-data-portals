A catalogue of public national and supranational [open data portals](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/open-data-portals).

## Aims and motivation

Broadly, to keep a record of the worldwide deployment of national open-data
portals.  To see how these portals compare in their implementation and
capabilities.  To map the adoption of free (libre) technological solutions.
To identify innovation in the public sector.  To attempt to transfer innovation
across national boundaries.  To determine the degree of involvement of and the
influence corporate interests have had on open-data portals on a national and
global scale.
